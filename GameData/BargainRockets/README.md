Backyard rocket parts

This was developed by Rubber Ducky back in 2013, the original forum thread

Rubber Ducky announced his inability to continue this moving forward in mid-2014

Updated by Astrofox and MeCripp for 1.2 on 12/30/2016, released on Dropbox

Repackaged by Linuxgurugamer for a more formal release and inclusion into CKAN

=====================================================================
After serious budget cuts at the Kerbal Space Agency, they turn to the one contractor they can still afford: Bargain Rocket Parts Inc.

Features:

- 34 brand new parts, mostly fashioned out of duct tape, cardboard, and whatever else we could find laying around for optimum cost-efficiency.

- Full IVA for the BC-1 Space Box command module.

- Tech-tree integration (using ModuleManager).

- Includes four new science experiments.

- Contracts! I imagine this mod is super unbalanced with the budgeting system, though

Note:  There is a ModuleManager config file to reorder the career tech tree.
The file is called BargainRockets.cfg
Remove the file to have the parts only appear in the sandbox.
