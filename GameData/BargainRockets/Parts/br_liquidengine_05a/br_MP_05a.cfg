description = We saw this in a movie and we were all like "Why didn't we think of that?" and then our intern was like "Oh, I totally thought of that and you guys didn't listen." He was promptly promoted to upper management. We haven't seen him in weeks; he might be lost.  Be sure to check your Fire Extinguishers yearly for proper working pressure.  If low, fill 'em up!
