This wonderful little (not so little) mod was originally written by @Rubber Ducky back in 2013.  It's been updated for 1.2 thanks to the efforts of @Astrofox and @MeCripp, I've adopted it to keep it going and get included into CKAN.

Please note that this mod will modify the stock tech tree, and is probably incompatible with any of the custom tech trees available.

After serious budget cuts at the Kerbal Space Agency, they turn to the one contractor they can still afford: Bargain Rocket Parts Inc.

Features:

- 34 brand new parts, mostly fashioned out of duct tape, cardboard, and whatever else we could find laying around for optimum cost-efficiency.

- Full IVA for the BC-1 Space Box command module.

- Tech-tree integration (using ModuleManager).

- Includes four new science experiments.

- Contracts! I imagine this mod is super unbalanced with the budgeting system, though

Note:  There is a ModuleManager config file to reorder the career tech tree.
The file is called BargainRockets.cfg
Remove the file to have the parts only appear in the sandbox.
